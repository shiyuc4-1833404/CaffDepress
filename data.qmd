# Data
Below are the two datasets that we propose to draw on for the project:   
1. [Mental Health - Depression Screener](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&Cycle=2017-2018)    
2. [Dietary Interview - Individual Foods, First Day](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Dietary&Cycle=2017-2018)    

Both of those datasets are downloaded from CDC National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 6,000 people each year. The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions.  

This project was to examine the dataset from 2017 to 2018. There were 7,640 participants who provided reliable responses to inquiries about caffeine consumption, and 5,533 participants who answered questions regarding depression. Participants’ depression levels were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale and the caffeine consumption was investigated in a private room of NHANES.  

Since the data are in the XPT (SAS file) format, we can use the haven package to import the data. In NHANES data, each sample person has a unique identifier called sequence number (SEQN). The next step is to merge two datasets by a unique identifier. However, the data file “Dietary Interview - Individual Foods” contains multiple records for each sample person and makes them not a unique identifier.
